// rung HEIGHT (device-meaningful and stable across sources, unlike bandwidth).
// A height lands here the FIRST time it goes decode-bound — which, because the
// renderer tries an FPS cap first, means "can't sustain even at half rate": a

// re-learn it. Small and self-correcting: the ceiling only ever rises to what
// the machine has actually failed at, and clearing site data resets it.
// The thumbnail pipeline's WASM module, kept for the whole page session.
//
// It used to be built fresh per video — a second emscripten instance, its own

// expensive thing a video change does, and it lands exactly where it hurts:
// alongside the new video's decode ramp, which is what pushed audio into
// underrun ("gap filled" → duck → the clicking) after a couple of playbacks.
// The module is stateless between videos; only the FFmpeg CONTEXT inside it is
// per-file, and that is still created and destroyed each time.
//
// Handlers (onReadRequest / _pendingSeek) live on the MODULE, so exactly one
// ThumbnailBindings may use it at a time. `inUse` enforces that: a second
// pipeline — which happens only in the overlap of an in-place quality switch —
// gets its own throwaway instance rather than corrupting this one.
