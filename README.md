## Precise host-driven annotation APIs

The custom element exposes two low-level APIs for applications that need frame-accurate annotation or evidence capture without using Movi's built-in controls:

```ts
import type { MoviElement, MoviCapturedFrame } from "movi-player/element";

const player = document.querySelector("movi-player") as MoviElement;

// Finite targets are clamped to the active media bounds. Rapid calls keep the
// active seek and coalesce the queued work so the newest target runs next.
const settledSeconds = await player.seekTo(12.4);

// Resolves only after the current frame can be captured. The returned bitmap is
// caller-owned and must be closed.
const captured: MoviCapturedFrame | null = await player.captureFrame();
try {
  if (captured) {
    console.log(captured.width, captured.height, captured.mediaTime);
  }
} finally {
  captured?.image.close();
}
```

`captureFrame()` performs no download or image encoding. It preserves Movi's hardware-decoder black-readback fallback by copying the retained decoded frame when the canvas readback is blank. The existing Snapshot control uses the same capture path and performs PNG encoding only for the user-requested download.

## Quickstart

One script tag, one element — this plays an MKV (or HEVC, AV1, HDR, multi-audio…) file that a plain `<video>` cannot open:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/movi-player/dist/element.js"></script>

<movi-player src="video.mkv" controls></movi-player>
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm i movi-player
```

```html
<script type="module">
  import "movi-player";
</script>

<movi-player src="video.mkv" controls></movi-player>
```

> Prefer the official hosted build? Load it straight from **`https://moviplayer.com/dist/element.js`** — always the latest release, and a drop-in on any page (no COOP/COEP or isolation headers required).

## Why Movi Player?

**The browser can't play MKV, HEVC, or HDR videos.** You either transcode everything server-side or tell users "format not supported." Movi Player fixes this.

- **Play anything** -- MKV, HEVC, AV1, 4K HDR, multi-audio, subtitles. Formats that `<video>` can't touch.
- **Zero server cost** -- No FFmpeg on your server. No transcoding pipeline. Everything runs in the browser via WebAssembly.
- **Drop-in replacement** -- `<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls>` works like `<video>` but plays everything — the full `HTMLMediaElement` API surface answers, so code written against a native `<video>` works unchanged.
- **Content protection** -- Built-in encrypted playback with AES-256-GCM, token auth, HMAC signing. No DRM license server needed.
- **HDR rendering** -- Detects and renders BT.2020/PQ/HLG content on supported displays. Other players can't.
- **Canvas-based** -- No `<video>` element exposed. Right-click save disabled.
- **Picture-in-Picture** -- Document PiP with controls (play/pause, seek, mute, progress). Chromium 116+.
- **Ambient mode** -- Dynamic letterbox glow that samples video colors in real-time. Press `G` or use context menu.
- **Split sources** -- Separate video and audio files via child `<source kind="audio">` elements, external subtitles via `<track>` — standard `<video>`-style markup.
- **Adaptive streaming** -- HLS (`.m3u8`), MPEG-DASH (`.mpd`), and Smooth Streaming (`.ism`) unified through Shaka Player, with a live-edge UI and DVR seeking.
- **Custom request headers** -- Send auth tokens / signed headers across manifests, segments, progressive HTTP, and the encrypted source via the `headers` attribute.
- **DRM ready** -- Optional Widevine/PlayReady/FairPlay support via `drm` + `licenseurl` attributes for adaptive streams.

<summary><b>Full feature overview</b> — everything in the box</summary>

<br />

**Playback** -- MP4, MKV, WebM, MOV, TS, AVI. H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1. Hardware decode with software fallback. Pitch-preserving time-stretch via Signalsmith Stretch.

**Adaptive Streaming** -- HLS (`.m3u8`), MPEG-DASH (`.mpd`), and Smooth Streaming (`.ism`) unified through Shaka Player (hls.js / dash.js fallbacks). Live-edge badge, DVR-window seeking, Auto-mode quality badge. Streams whose codec the browser can't decode escalate through the other MSE engine and finally the built-in FFmpeg-WASM demuxer, keeping quality switching and track menus working. Optional MPEG-5 LCEVC enhancement-layer decoding via `lcevc` + `lcevcurl`.

**Adaptive Quality** -- An "Auto" mode measures the link's real throughput (past CDN pacing bursts), opens on the rung it can sustain, and switches renditions seamlessly in place — no reload, no dropped playhead. Works for HLS/DASH and plain multi-file quality ladders alike.

**Custom Headers** -- Send auth tokens / signed headers across the whole media flow (manifest, segments, progressive HTTP, thumbnails, encrypted source) via the `headers` attribute (JSON) or property (object).

**Audio** -- AAC, MP3, Opus, FLAC, AC-3, E-AC-3. Multi-track switching. **Output-device routing** (`audiooutput` attribute / `setAudioOutput()` / right-click "Audio Output" menu, via `AudioContext.setSinkId`). Stable volume (loudness normalization). First-class audio-only mode with cover art extraction and a dedicated strip UI. Data-saver `audioonly` mode skips the video decode (and fetches an audio-only stream rendition). Perceptual (log) volume curve. Muted-autoplay fallback with tap-to-unmute.

**Non-Range Servers** -- Servers that ignore `Range` (respond `200`, not `206`) still play via a forward-only sliding-window "linear mode" with in-window seeking; the `linearmode` event lets your UI adapt.

**Subtitles** -- SRT, ASS, WebVTT, PGS (image-based), DVB. Multi-track with on-the-fly switching. Per-source delay/offset (`Z` / `X` to nudge ±100ms), full transcript browser with search + click-to-seek, customizable size/color/background/edge (persisted), karaoke-aligned VTT. Pluggable `SubtitleRenderer` hook for full ASS/SSA styling via an external renderer (e.g. jassub).

**HDR** -- BT.2020/PQ/HLG detection + Display-P3 rendering on supported browsers.

**Immersive / VR** -- 360° equirectangular, 180° (VR180), fisheye, side-by-side stereo (3D), and stereographic "little planet" video via a WebGL2 raycast with a spring-animated look-around camera. Auto-enters from the source's spherical metadata (no toggle UI) or force a projection with the `vr` attribute (`vr="180 fisheye sbs"`, `vr="littleplanet"`); opt-in on-screen joystick via `vrpad`.

**UI** -- Controls, context menu, keyboard shortcuts (`?` to view all), themes (dark/light), gestures, ambient mode. Settings live behind a single gear panel; the bar groups controls into capsules and cuts real chapter gaps through the progress track.

**Custom Controls** -- `addControl()` adds host-defined buttons and context-menu rows that sit with the built-ins (toggles, hotkeys, nested submenus, per-surface anchors); `showOverlay()` puts host panels (end screens, up-next cards) over the picture, including in fullscreen.

**Native `<video>` Parity** -- All `HTMLMediaElement` / `HTMLVideoElement` members answer — `buffered`/`seekable`/`played`, `textTracks`/`audioTracks`/`videoTracks`, `srcObject`, `canPlayType`, `captureStream`, `getVideoPlaybackQuality`, `requestVideoFrameCallback`, `setSinkId`, `fastSeek` — plus the standard event set (`seeking`/`seeked`, `durationchange`, `abort`, `suspend`, `cuechange`, …). Every documented attribute reflects as a JS property (`el.rotate = 90`).

**Persistent Preferences** -- Volume, mute, playback rate, stable volume, ambient mode, and HDR toggles persist across reloads via OPFS. User choices override HTML attribute defaults. The `persist` attribute takes over that decision explicitly — an opt-in list of exactly which settings (including audio/subtitle language) are remembered, namespaced by `persistkey`.

**Picture-in-Picture** -- Document PiP with play/pause, seek, mute, progress bar. Press `P`.

**Aspect Ratio** -- Press `A` to cycle contain/cover/fill/zoom. Context menu sub-menu with icons.

**Crop Bars** -- `cropbars` strips letterbox/pillarbox padding baked into the source pixels before applying `cover`/`fill`/`zoom`, detected automatically with a conservative check so dark scenes are never mistaken for bars.

**Nerd Stats** -- Press `I` for codec, resolution, FPS, decoder type, buffer health, network graph. HLS-aware stats. 8K/16K resolutions labeled correctly.

**Timeline** -- Press `T` for thumbnail strip. Chapter-aware. Keyboard navigation (arrows + enter).

**Chapters** -- Auto-detected from video metadata; or supplied from outside the file via the `chapters` attribute/property. Markers on progress bar, titles in seek tooltip.

**Rotation** -- Press `R` to rotate 90, or set the `rotate` attribute (`0`/`90`/`180`/`270`). Metadata rotation auto-applied. Thumbnails sync.

**Resume** -- `<movi-player resume>` saves position to localStorage, shows resume dialog on reload. Keyboard navigable.

**Poster from Timestamp** -- `postertime="10%"` (or `"5"`, `"1:30"`, `"0:01:30"`) generates a native-resolution poster frame from any timestamp. Runs on an isolated thumbnail pipeline, respects rotation metadata, and never paints stale frames after a `src` change.

**Encrypted** -- AES-256-GCM chunked encryption with HMAC-signed token auth. See encrypted-server/.

**Custom SourceAdapter** -- Plug any byte protocol (WebSocket, WebRTC, IndexedDB, custom encryption) directly into the element or player. Same `SourceAdapter` contract works across `<movi-player>`, `MoviPlayer`, and `Demuxer`; `registerSourceAdapter()` teaches the element custom `src` schemes (`s3://`, `ipfs://`, …) with no per-element wiring.

**DRM** -- Optional Widevine/FairPlay for HLS streams via `drm` + `licenseurl` attributes. Uses native `<video>` + EME API.

**Premuxed Quality Menu** -- Multiple `<source data-height="...">` children give you a YouTube-style quality picker for plain MP4/MKV files, no HLS manifest needed.

**File Revoked Recovery** -- Mobile browsers silently revoke `File` handles after long backgrounding; the `filerevoked` event fires so playlist UIs can prompt for re-pick instead of hanging forever.

**Host Fullscreen Handoff** -- Cancelable `movi-fullscreen-request` event + `setHostFullscreen()` so embedders (VS Code webview, custom apps) can take over fullscreen and keep the player's UI in sync. `exitFullscreen()` covers every fullscreen route.

**Host Error Screen** -- Restyle the built-in error overlay via `::part()`, replace it outright with `slot="error"`, and read the exact on-screen wording from the `errordisplay` event.

### Alternatives

Evaluating Movi Player against the ecosystem:

- **[video.js](https://videojs.com/), [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), [Vidstack](https://vidstack.io/) and [Media Chrome](https://www.media-chrome.org/)** are UI players for browser-**native** formats (MP4/WebM) and HLS/DASH — they can't open a raw MKV, HEVC or AV1 file.
- **[hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) and [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js)** are streaming *engines* (no arbitrary-file playback); **[Shaka Player](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player)** is the DASH/HLS heavyweight. All three need content pre-packaged into adaptive streams server-side.
- For playing an **arbitrary file** (MKV / AV1 / HEVC / 4K HDR) with **zero server work**, the closest peers are **[ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)** — a transcode/processing *library*, not a player, that CPU-decodes (heavy, no GPU) — and **[libmedia](https://github.com/zhaohappy/libmedia)**, a WASM + WebCodecs media SDK.

Movi Player's niche is that same WebCodecs + FFmpeg-WASM playback, delivered as a **drop-in `<movi-player>` web component** with a batteries-included UI — HDR, chapters, multi-audio, built-in subtitles, ambient mode, Document PiP and encrypted playback — so it's a practical **alternative to video.js / hls.js / Shaka Player** when your files aren't browser-native, and a friendlier, GPU-accelerated **alternative to ffmpeg.wasm / libmedia** when you want a player, not a toolkit.

## What's New in 0.4.0

The headline changes — see the [full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for everything:

- **[Custom controls API](#custom-controls-and-overlays)** — `addControl()` puts your own buttons in the player's bar and context menu (toggles, hotkeys, nested submenus); `showOverlay()` layers your own panels (end screens, up-next) over the picture, including in fullscreen.
- **[Engine selection](#engine-selection-and-native-fallback)** — the `engine` attribute picks which playback engine leads (`wasm`, `shaka`, `dashjs`, `hlsjs`, `native`) and what follows it; `fallback="native"` hands unplayable sources to a wrapped `<video>` instead of a dead end.
- **Seamless quality switching + true Auto quality** — manual and adaptive rendition changes swap in place with no reload, no dropped playhead; Auto mode measures real link throughput and opens on the right rung, on HLS/DASH and plain multi-file ladders alike.
- **Full native `<video>` parity** — all 78 `HTMLMediaElement`/`HTMLVideoElement` members answer, ten more standard events fire, and every documented attribute reflects as a JS property.
- **[External chapters](#chapters)** — a `chapters` attribute/property for sources that keep chapters outside the container (CMS, watch page).
- **`cropbars`** — strips letterbox/pillarbox padding baked into the source pixels before `cover`/`fill`/`zoom`.
- **`titlemode` and granular `fastseek`** — control where the title bar appears (with an optional back arrow firing a cancelable `back` event), and which skip affordances (`buttons` / `keys` / `gestures`) are on.
- **[Slim build](#slim-build)** — `movi-player/element/slim` ships the FFmpeg WASM as a separate cacheable `movi.wasm` (4.2MB JS vs. 11.4MB), with slim twins for the React/Vue/Svelte wrappers.
- **Firefox extension** — the same player-in-a-tab experience as the Chrome extension, built from one shared codebase.
- **Host-supplied error screen** — restyle via `::part()`, replace via `slot="error"`, observe via the `errordisplay` event.
- **Pluggable `SubtitleRenderer`** — plug in a custom ASS/SSA renderer (e.g. jassub) for full styling.
- **`registerSourceAdapter()`** — teach the player custom `src` schemes (`s3://`, `ipfs://`, `ws://`) globally.
- **Settings-change events** — `aspectchange`, `loopchange`, `stablevolumechange`, `hdrchange`, `ambientchange`, `rotatechange`, `audioonlychange`.
- **VS Code IntelliSense** — attribute/value completion with hover docs for `<movi-player>`, plus CSS completion for the `--movi-*` theme variables.

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
npm i movi-player
```

Or skip the install entirely and load from a CDN as in the [Quickstart](#quickstart). Browser and editor integrations live in [`chrome-extension/`](chrome-extension/), [`firefox-extension/`](firefox-extension/), and [`vscode-extension/`](vscode-extension/).

### HTML Element (simplest)

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/movi-player/dist/element.js"></script>

<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls autoplay muted></movi-player>
```

Or with npm:

```html
<script type="module">
  import "movi-player";
</script>

<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls autoplay muted></movi-player>
```

### Local File

```html
<movi-player id="player" controls></movi-player>
<input type="file" onchange="document.getElementById('player').src = this.files[0]" />
```

### React / Vue / Svelte

Typed wrappers ship in the package — same attributes as the element, as props:

```tsx
import { MoviPlayer } from "movi-player/react";

<MoviPlayer src="video.mkv" controls />
```

- **Vue**: `import { MoviPlayer } from "movi-player/vue"`
- **Svelte**: `import MoviPlayer from "movi-player/svelte"`
- Typed `<source>` / `<track>` children via `MoviSource` / `MoviTrack` — named exports of `movi-player/react` and `movi-player/vue`; Svelte imports them per file, from `movi-player/svelte/MoviSource` and `movi-player/svelte/MoviTrack`.
- Each wrapper has a [slim](#slim-build) twin: `movi-player/react/slim`, `movi-player/vue/slim`, `movi-player/svelte/slim`.

### Modules

| Module | Size | Gzip | Brotli | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `movi-player` / `movi-player/element` | ~410KB | 3.13 MB | 2.37 MB | Full player with UI, controls, gestures |
| `movi-player/element/slim` | ~410KB | 1.00 MB + WASM | 750 KB + WASM | Same player, WASM shipped as a separate `movi.wasm` |
| `movi-player/player` | ~180KB | 3.15 MB | 2.38 MB | Programmatic playback, no UI |
| `movi-player/demuxer` | ~50KB | 2.37 MB | 1.79 MB | Metadata extraction, decoding only |

## Common Use Cases

### Adaptive Streaming (HLS / DASH / Smooth)

```html
<!-- HLS -->
<movi-player src="https://example.com/master.m3u8" controls autoplay muted></movi-player>

<!-- MPEG-DASH -->
<movi-player src="https://example.com/manifest.mpd" controls autoplay muted></movi-player>

<!-- Smooth Streaming -->
<movi-player src="https://example.com/manifest.ism/manifest" controls autoplay muted></movi-player>
```

`.m3u8`, `.mpd`, and `.ism` are unified through Shaka Player (with hls.js / dash.js as automatic fallbacks) and drawn to the same canvas pipeline, so the quality menu, stats, and track switching work identically across all three. Live streams get a `LIVE` badge, jump-to-edge, DVR-window seeking, and an Auto-mode quality badge. Streams whose codec the browser can't decode escalate to the built-in FFmpeg-WASM demuxer automatically, keeping quality and track switching intact.

### External Subtitles (`<track>`)

Standard `<video>`-style markup, no JS wiring needed. Treats `kind="subtitles"`, `kind="captions"`, or no `kind` as caption tracks. `data-format="srt"` to load SRT instead of the default VTT.

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="subs-en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" kind="subtitles" default>
  <track src="subs-hi.vtt" srclang="hi" label="Hindi" kind="subtitles">
  <track src="subs-jp.srt" srclang="ja" label="Japanese" kind="subtitles" data-format="srt">
</movi-player>
```

### Split Video + Audio Sources

Separate video and audio files via child `<source>` elements with `kind="audio"`:

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="video-only.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="audio-only.m4a" type="audio/mp4" kind="audio">
</movi-player>
```

### Multi-Language Audio

Declare two or more `<source kind="audio">` tags with `srclang` (or `label`) and the player surfaces an audio-language menu. Default pick: explicit `default` / `data-default`, else the first match for the page locale, else the first one.

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="audio-en.m4a" type="audio/mp4" kind="audio" srclang="en" label="English" default>
  <source src="audio-hi.m4a" type="audio/mp4" kind="audio" srclang="hi" label="Hindi">
  <source src="audio-ja.m4a" type="audio/mp4" kind="audio" srclang="ja" label="Japanese">
</movi-player>
```

### Quality Menu from Plain Files

Declare multiple video sources with `data-height` to get a YouTube-style quality picker without an HLS manifest — with seamless in-place switching and an Auto (adaptive) mode when bitrates are declared:

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="video-1080p.mp4" type="video/mp4" data-height="1080" data-label="1080p">
  <source src="video-720p.mp4"  type="video/mp4" data-height="720"  data-label="720p">
  <source src="video-480p.mp4"  type="video/mp4" data-height="480"  data-label="480p">
</movi-player>
```

### Chapters

Chapters embedded in MKV/MP4 containers are picked up automatically — markers on the progress bar, titles in the seek tooltip. For sources that keep chapters elsewhere (a CMS, a watch page), pass them in:

```html
<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls
  chapters='[{"title":"Intro","start":0},{"title":"The Build","start":95},{"title":"Results","start":310}]'>
</movi-player>
```

Or as a property: `player.chapters = [{ title, start, end? }]` (times in seconds). Supplied chapters win over the container's.

Add `image` to a chapter and the timeline strip shows that artwork instead of decoding a frame at `start` — the picture you chose, and one less seek per chapter:

```js
player.chapters = [
  { title: "Intro", start: 0, image: "/art/intro.jpg" },
  { title: "The Build", start: 95 },   // no image → a frame from the video
];
```

A URL that fails to load falls back to the same title-only tile a missing frame gets.

### Remembering Viewer Settings

By default the player remembers volume, mute, speed, and its toggles on its own. The `persist` attribute takes over that decision explicitly — an opt-in list of exactly what is remembered:

```html
<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls
             persist="volume speed audiolang subtitlelang"
             persistkey="my-app"></movi-player>
```

Settings: `loop`, `muted`, `volume`, `speed`, `ambient`, `stablevolume`, `hdr`, `aspect`, `cropbars`, `audiolang`, `subtitlelang`. Languages are remembered as a *language*, not a track number, and matched against each new file's tracks. `persistkey` namespaces the store so two players on a page don't share preferences. See [`persist`](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/element#persist) in the docs.

### Resume and Posters

```html
<movi-player src="video.mp4" controls resume postertime="10%"></movi-player>
```

`resume` saves the position to localStorage and shows a resume dialog on reload. `postertime` accepts `"5"`, `"1:30"`, `"0:01:30"`, or `"10%"` and renders a native-resolution frame — no pre-rendered thumbnail needed.

## Advanced

### Custom Controls and Overlays

`addControl()` puts a control of your own in the player's chrome — the bottom bar, the right-click menu, or both — so it sits with the built-ins instead of beside them. Described once; the player builds the button and the menu row, keeps them in sync, and removes them together.

```js
player.addControl({
  id: "autoplay-next",
  label: "Autoplay",
  icon: '<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">…</svg>',
  before: "cc",            // sits just left of the subtitles button
  placement: "both",       // bar AND context menu, one shared state
  toggle: true,
  hotkey: "shift+a",       // appears in the shortcuts panel, flashes the OSD
  onSelect: (on) => setAutoplay(on),
});
```

Controls can open nested submenus (`items` / `onPick`, any depth), persist their toggle state (`persist: true`), group into a bar capsule of their own (`group`), anchor differently per surface (`anchors: { bar, menu }` — an anchor can be a list for a neighbour that only sometimes exists), and declare `media: "video" | "audio" | "both"` to hide themselves for content they don't apply to. `updateControl(id, patch)` and `removeControl(id)` manage them afterwards.

Host overlays put your own panel over the picture — including in fullscreen:

```js
player.showOverlay({
  id: "up-next",
  content: upNextCard,           // markup or an Element
  placement: "bottom-end",       // "fill" | "center" | "bottom-end"
  dismissOn: ["play", "escape"],
});
// later: player.updateOverlay("up-next", { content }) / player.hideOverlay("up-next")
```

Full spec: [Custom Controls](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/element#custom-controls) in the docs.

### Engine Selection and Native Fallback

Movi has multiple ways to play a source and a sensible built-in order: its own WASM demuxer + WebCodecs pipeline first, Shaka (then dash.js / hls.js) for adaptive manifests, the browser's `<video>` last. The `engine` attribute re-orders that — the first name leads, any others replace the built-in escalation:

```html
<!-- Play through the browser; fall back to Movi's pipeline only if it can't -->
<movi-player src="video.mp4" engine="native wasm" controls></movi-player>

<!-- Prefer dash.js over Shaka for manifests -->
<movi-player src="manifest.mpd" engine="dashjs shaka" controls></movi-player>
```

Values: `wasm`, `shaka`, `dashjs`, `hlsjs`, `native`.

`fallback="native"` handles the other direction — a source Movi itself can't read (a no-CORS cross-origin file, a transient network failure) is handed to the browser's own `<video>` wrapped in the player's controls instead of a dead end. The degraded surface keeps a `<source>` quality ladder switching in place, parses `<track>` subtitles into Movi's own overlay, and syncs a companion `<audio>` for split video+audio sources. The `nativefallback` event tells you it happened.

```html
<movi-player src="video.mkv" fallback="native" controls></movi-player>
```

### Slim Build

`movi-player/element/slim` is the same `<movi-player>` element with the same API — only the WASM ships differently. The default build embeds the FFmpeg WASM inside the JS (11.4 MB of JS); the slim build keeps it as a separate `movi.wasm` (4.2 MB JS + 5.6 MB WASM), so the engine streams and compiles as a cacheable asset and the JS parses far faster. If the WASM can't be fetched, playback falls back to the browser's native `<video>` automatically — no `fallback="native"` needed.

```typescript
import "movi-player/element/slim";
```

You host `movi.wasm` yourself — it ships in the package at `movi-player/dist/movi.wasm`. Vite / webpack 5 / Parcel 2 emit it automatically; otherwise copy it next to your bundle or point at it with `wasmurl`:

```html
<movi-player
  src="video.mkv"
  wasmurl="https://cdn.example.com/movi-player/movi.wasm"
  controls
></movi-player>
```

The framework wrappers have slim twins too — `movi-player/react/slim`, `movi-player/vue/slim`, `movi-player/svelte/slim` — same components, same props. At runtime, `MoviElement.build` / `el.build` reports `"slim"` or `"full"`, and `MoviElement.version` / `el.version` the package version. See [Modules](https://moviplayer.com/docs/guide/modules) for details.

### Custom Request Headers

```html
<!-- JSON attribute -->
<movi-player
  src="https://example.com/master.m3u8"
  headers='{"Authorization":"Bearer <token>"}'
  controls autoplay muted
></movi-player>
```

```js
// Or the property (preferred for non-trivial maps)
player.headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` };
```

Headers ride along on every media request -- manifest + segments, progressive HTTP, thumbnails, and the encrypted source.

### Encrypted Playback

```html
<movi-player
  encrypted
  tokenurl="/api/token"
  videourl="/api/video"
  videoid="movie.mp4"
  controls autoplay muted
></movi-player>
```

AES-256-GCM encrypted, HMAC signed, 2s token expiry, IP + fingerprint binding.
See [encrypted-server/](encrypted-server/) for the server example.

### DRM (Widevine / PlayReady / FairPlay)

```html
<movi-player
  src="https://example.com/encrypted.m3u8"
  drm
  licenseurl="https://license.pallycon.com/ri/licenseManager.do"
  controls autoplay
></movi-player>
```

Requires a DRM license server (PallyCon, EZDRM, BuyDRM, etc.). Key systems are tried Widevine → PlayReady → FairPlay. Extra headers for the license request only (auth token, customer ID) go in `licenseheaders` (a JSON object string). In DRM mode, the native `<video>` element is used (canvas features like rotation are disabled).

### Programmatic Playback (no UI)

```typescript
import { MoviPlayer } from "movi-player/player";

const player = new MoviPlayer({
  source: { type: "url", url: "video.mp4" },
  canvas: document.getElementById("canvas"),
});

await player.load();
await player.play();
```

See the [Programmatic API guide](https://moviplayer.com/docs/guide/programmatic-api).

### Demuxer Only (50KB)

![Demuxer](docs/images/demuxer.webp)

[Live Demo](https://movi-player-examples.vercel.app/demuxer.html) | [Source](https://github.com/MrUjjwalG/movi-player-examples/blob/main/demuxer.html)

Extract metadata, tracks, HDR info, and thumbnails without playing the video.

```typescript
import { Demuxer, HttpSource } from "movi-player/demuxer";

const demuxer = new Demuxer(new HttpSource("video.mp4"));
const info = await demuxer.open();

console.log(`Duration: ${info.duration}s, Format: ${info.formatName}`);
console.log(`Chapters: ${info.chapters.length}`);

const video = demuxer.getVideoTracks()[0];
console.log(`${video.width}x${video.height} ${video.codec} ${video.frameRate}fps`);
console.log(`HDR: ${video.isHDR}, Color: ${video.colorPrimaries}/${video.colorTransfer}`);

const audio = demuxer.getAudioTracks();
console.log(`Audio: ${audio.map(a => `${a.codec} ${a.language}`).join(", ")}`);

const subs = demuxer.getSubtitleTracks();
console.log(`Subtitles: ${subs.map(s => `${s.codec} ${s.language}`).join(", ")}`);

demuxer.close();
```

Use cases: video validators, asset management, HDR detection pipelines, search indexing, format analysis before transcoding.

### Custom Source Adapters

Plug any byte protocol (WebSocket, WebRTC, IndexedDB, custom encryption) into the element, player, or demuxer via the `SourceAdapter` contract. `registerSourceAdapter()` teaches the player custom `src` schemes globally — no per-element wiring:

```typescript
import { registerSourceAdapter } from "movi-player";

registerSourceAdapter("s3", (config) => new MyS3Source(config.url));
```

```html
<movi-player src="s3://bucket/video.mkv" controls></movi-player>
```

See [Sources](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/sources) in the docs.

### Embedding Hooks

- **Host fullscreen handoff** — a cancelable `movi-fullscreen-request` event plus `setHostFullscreen()` let embedders (VS Code webview, custom apps) take over fullscreen and keep the player's UI in sync; `exitFullscreen()` covers all fullscreen routes.
- **Host error screen** — every piece of the built-in error overlay carries a `part=` for `::part()` restyling; `slot="error"` replaces it outright; the `errordisplay` event (and `errorTitle` / `errorMessage` properties) carries the exact wording on screen, including format/codec failures that never raise a runtime `error`. See [Customizing the Error Screen](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/element#customizing-the-error-screen).
- **`noerrorscreen`** — suppress the built-in error overlays entirely and render your own.

### Events

The standard `HTMLMediaElement` events all fire (`loadedmetadata`, `canplay`, `play`, `pause`, `seeking`/`seeked`, `timeupdate`, `progress`, `durationchange`, `ended`, `error`, `volumechange`, `ratechange`, …), so `<video>`-oriented code works unchanged. Movi adds its own:

<details>
<summary><b>Player-specific events</b></summary>

<br />

| Event | Payload | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `statechange` | `PlayerState` | Underlying player state transitioned |
| `errordisplay` | `{ title, message, canRetry, canTrySoftware }` | An error screen went up — the wording the viewer sees, including codec failures that raise no runtime `error` |
| `trackschange` | `Track[]` | Available tracks list updated |
| `audiotrackchange` / `subtitletrackchange` | — | Active audio / subtitle track switched |
| `qualitychange` | `{ trackId }` | Active video quality / track switched |
| `subtitledelaychange` | `{ subtitleDelay }` | Subtitle offset changed |
| `aspectchange`, `loopchange`, `stablevolumechange`, `hdrchange`, `ambientchange`, `rotatechange`, `audioonlychange` | setting-specific | A viewer changed a setting — persist it host-side if you want |
| `fullscreenchange` | `{ fullscreen }` | Entered/exited fullscreen |
| `movi-fullscreen-request` | cancelable | Before `requestFullscreen()` — `preventDefault()` to take over via `setHostFullscreen()` |
| `back` | cancelable | The `titlemode` back arrow was pressed |
| `pipchange` (+ `enterpictureinpicture` / `leavepictureinpicture`) | `{ pip }` | PiP window opened/closed |
| `titlechange` | `{ title }` | Displayed title changed |
| `coverart` | `ImageBitmap \| null` | Embedded cover art extracted |
| `audiooutputchange` | `{ deviceId }` | Audio routed to a different output device |
| `audiostripchange` | `{ active }` | Audio-only strip layout entered/left |
| `preloadcomplete` | — | Initial preload buffer filled |
| `linearmode` | — | Server ignores `Range` — playback is forward-only; hide seek-dependent UI |
| `nativefallback` | `{ src }` | Source handed to a native `<video>` (`fallback="native"`) |
| `filerevoked` | `{ offset, length, reason }` | The browser revoked the underlying `File` handle — prompt a re-pick |
| `movi-control` | control-specific | A custom control added via `addControl()` was used |
| `movi-qoe` | QoE snapshot | Playback-quality telemetry sample |

</details>

Full list with payload types: [Events](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/events).

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `?` during playback to toggle the shortcuts panel (also available from the right-click context menu).

<details>
<summary><b>Shortcut table</b></summary>

|---|---|---|---|
| `Space` / `K` | Play / Pause | `B` | Cycle audio track |
| `F` | Fullscreen | `L` | Toggle loop |
| `M` | Mute | `U` | Toggle stable volume |

| `1` – `9` | Seek to 10%–90% | | |

</details>

### Theming

The UI is themeable through `--movi-*` CSS custom properties (accent colours, radii, control sizes, shadows, transitions) — set them on the element or any ancestor. The full variable list ships in [`custom-elements.json`](custom-elements.json) and the [element docs](https://moviplayer.com/docs/api/element#theming), with IntelliSense in VS Code via the [extension](vscode-extension/).

## Server Requirements

Videos served over HTTP need:

1. **Range requests** -- for seeking
2. **CORS headers** -- if cross-origin

**COOP/COEP headers are _optional_.** The WASM engine is single-threaded with Asyncify I/O, so it plays fine **without** `SharedArrayBuffer` — no isolation headers, no service worker, no "Security Headers Missing" screen. Setting them only enables an optional **zero-copy `SharedArrayBuffer` fast-path** for HTTP streaming; without them `HttpSource` uses a plain-buffer path and streams normally.

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

On static hosts where you can't set response headers (GitHub Pages, Netlify free tier, etc.), [coi-serviceworker](https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker) can inject these client-side if you want the fast-path — but it's no longer required to play.

## Browser Support

| Browser | WebCodecs | HDR |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome 110+ | Yes | Yes |
| Edge 110+ | Yes | Yes |
| Safari 18+ | Yes | Yes |
| Firefox 130+ | Yes | Limited |

## Development

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mrujjwalg/movi-player.git
cd movi-player
npm install
npm run build:wasm    # Requires Docker
npm run build:ts
npm run dev
```

## AI Assistants

[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) is a tour of the architecture, public API, and the
non-obvious tradeoffs (4K rate cap, ambient-mode cost, `.ts` long-GOP handling,
audio threshold ↔ AudioContext `latencyHint` coupling, etc.). It's written for
AI coding assistants — Claude, Cursor, Codex, Copilot — but humans onboarding
to the codebase will find it useful too.

The file ships inside the npm package as well, so when you install
`movi-player` you can point your assistant at
`node_modules/movi-player/AGENTS.md` (most tools either pick it up
automatically from the workspace or accept it via an `@-mention`). Filename
follows the [AGENTS.md convention](https://agents.md/) so newer tools that
auto-discover it work out of the box.
